Track Elementor Pro Popup events in Google Analytics.

== Description ==

This small utility plugin will allow you to track Elementor Pro Popup events in Google Analytics. Works with both the Universal tag and the new Tag Manager.

**Note**: The plugin expects you to have Google Analytics tag installed. It will not add Analytics tracking code on your behalf.

Also, it will only track events for Popups on the frontend, when the user is **not logged in**. So, to test, use the Incognito mode.

= Minimum Requirements =

* Elementor Pro version 2.7.0 or greater

= Installation and Usage =

1. Install using the WordPress built-in Plugin installer, or Extract the zip file and drop the contents in the `wp-content/plugins/` directory of your WordPress installation.

3. Create a new popup. Go to settings, scroll down to the "GA Tracking" section.
4. Enable GA Tracking and configure the Event Category and Label.

For any queries, open an issue in the support form.
